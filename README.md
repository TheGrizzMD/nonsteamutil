# nonsteamutil

Python Utility to add a non-steam game to Steam Deck

This was created from scottrice's Ice and Pysteam projects, with help from CorporalQuesadilla's Steam-Shortcut-Manager\
as well.

I had to update the code for Python 3, and the functionality has been reduced to just appending a game to shortcuts.vdf\
