# nonsteamutil

Python Utility to add a non-steam game to Steam Deck

This was created from scottrice's Ice and Pysteam projects, with help from CorporalQuesadilla's Steam-Shortcut-Manager\
as well.

I had to update the code for Python 3, and the functionality has been reduced to just appending a game to shortcuts.vdf\

The directory structure should look like this:

Application Directory
    /utils
        /nonsteamutil
            /config.txt
    /Steam-Artwork
      /icon.png
      /lastplayed.png
      /hero.png
      /logo.png
      /portrait.png
